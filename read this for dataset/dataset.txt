Create a new folder called "dataset".
This folder should contain all the JSON files of the FHIR data for each patient.
These files will be directly used in our "backend" folder by our data-pipeline -> "load_data.py" for loading the data to our PostgresSQL database
And also by our backend FastAPI server -> "main.py".
